I HAVE FOUND A GLITCH IN GODOT.
	-WHILE EDITING A TEXT FILE, A SINGLE QUOTE WILL CAUSE ALL FUTURE TEXT TO FAIL
	TO PROPELY COLLAPSE WITH SIDE DOWN ARROWS
	-THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN EDITING A GDSCRIPT FILE, SUCH A QUOTE
	WOULD INDICATE THE BEGINNING OF A STRING, BUT IN A TEXT FILE SUCH A THING IS NOT WANTED

Character Structure:
	Hitbox
	Body (several seperate elements)
		Head
			NPC: Looks back and forth when guarding.  Otherwise faces direction
				of movement
			Player: Looks wherever mouse is
		Torso
			NPC: Always faces direction of movement
			Player: Always faces mouse
		Arms - switch sprites depending on the held item
		Legs - typically not visible unless movement is occurring
	Item (probably weapon)
	HealthComponent: handle damage, wound, and death
		health
		max_health
	MoveComponent: handle accel/deccel, and max speed
		velocity
		max_speed
		accel
		deccel
	AimComponent: handle natural inaccuracy and recoil.  Sustained recoil results in worse accuracy
			as does moving while firing
		offset
		stability
	Controller (contains signals controlling Character)
		NPC: State machine
		Player: Input handler

Enemy State Machine
	Guarding: Head looks back and forth, and with it a detection cone.
		Exit:
			player spotted: Enter attacking or investigating, depending on length of spot
			sound heard: Enter Investigating
	Patrolling: Head looks back and forth while walking along a set path
		Exit:
			player spotted: Enter attacking or investigating, depending on length of spot
			sound heard: Enter Investigating
	Investigating: Pathfinding to investigate a sound or potential player
		Exit:
			arrival to target and timer timeout: return to original Guarding location.
			Player found: Enter Attacking
	Attacking: Moves to be within range of Player, then fire
		Exit:
			Player not in LOS: Investigate the last known position of the player

Unarmed State Machine
	Wander: Slowly move from one random point to another (may need revision)
		Exit: Gunfire heard.  Enter Cowaring state
	Fleeing: Move to a position further from the threat, or possibly the exit
		Exit:
			position reached: enter cowering
			exit reached: despawn
	Cowaring: stay still until a threat is seen
		Exit: Enter Fleeing

Class ModifiableValue:
	base_value: float
	modifiers: Array[Effect]
	value
		get:
			# apply modifiers to base_value

Weapon Breakdown:
	damage
		-amount of damage applied by bullet
	bullet speed
		-velocity of bullets

	weapon type
		-enum naming weapon # may need revision!!!
	ammo type
		-enum naming weapon ammo type # may need revision!!!

	fire time
		-time before weapon can be fired again
	reload timer:
		sets time that the weapon cannot fire while reloading


	base_inaccuracy
		-affects weapon sway when not moving
		-by swaying the weapon, inaccuracy can be achieved without making bullets come out of the
		barrel at strange angles
	move_inaccuarcy_coefficient
		-affects weapon sway when moving
		-true_inaccuracy = base inaccuracy + velocity/max_velocity * move_inaccuarcy_coefficient
	recoil (in degrees)
		after a shot the weapon is rotated by this value and tweened to return to original position
	recoil reset coefficient
		-Pulls weapon to center faster if it is further from directly on.
		-This prevents weapon from going ridiculously off course, because at some point the weapon
		will move back faster than the recoil will offset it


Level planning:
	Levels:
		Politicians (in their houses, at meetings, in congress)
		Bureaucrats
		IRS
		FBI
		CIA
		ATF
		USPTO (US Patent and Trademark Office)
		The President
	In order:
		Tutorial:
			-Department of Homeland Security detects that there are signs of life on an
			abandoned piece of property, despite no record of anyone living there: a raid is
			deployed.
			-Player quickly grabs weapons and fights off raid while hiding identity with a mask
