S.T.A.T.E.: Subjagation, Tyranny, Atrocity:  Totality Enforced

A rogue citizen is pushed too far by the government, and tired of the mindless
drivel poured out by the democratically elected politicians, decides to take
matters into his own hands.

"It's not called a dystopia only because we are desensitized to it."

Core Elements:
	Fast-paced top-down shooter in the same sense as Hotline Miami
	Targets bureaucrats, politicians, and corporations working with the government

Shooting:
	Fast projectiles (no bullet hell)
	Very short TTK (maybe not always one shot, but close)
	Grabbing weapons from fallen enemies will be possible, but the player may
		also reload their weapon
